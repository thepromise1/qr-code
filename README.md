Here is a clean, ready-to-use `README.md` file based on the Frontend Mentor template. I’ve polished the structure and left placeholders for your specific details.

## My process

### Built with

* **Semantic HTML5** - For accessibility and structure.
* **CSS Custom Properties** - For efficient color and typography management.
* **Flexbox** - Used for centering the component on the viewport.
* **Mobile-first workflow** - Ensuring the design looks great on all screens.

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on perfecting the "centered card" layout. I reinforced my understanding of how to use `min-height: 100vh` on the body to ensure the content stays vertically centered regardless of screen size.

```css
body{
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    min-height: 100vh;
   
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

1. Explore **CSS Grid** for more complex layouts.
2. Implement **Aria-labels** more consistently to improve screen-reader accessibility.
3. Start using **Utility-first CSS** frameworks like Tailwind.

### AI Collaboration

I collaborated with **Gemini** to help streamline my workflow:

* **Refactoring:** Used AI to suggest more concise CSS selectors.
* **Documentation:** AI helped generate the base for this `README.md` to ensure professional standards.
* **Debugging:** Used AI to double-check color contrast ratios for accessibility.

Would you like me to help you write the specific **CSS** to center this card perfectly, or perhaps help you generate a **box-shadow** that matches the design?
